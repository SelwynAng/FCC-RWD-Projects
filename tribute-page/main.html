            In December 1818, Raffles left Calcutta in search of a new British settlement to replace Malacca. 
            Malacca was one of the many British territories returned to the Dutch under the Treaty of Vienna. 
            Raffles had foreseen that without a strategic British trading post located within the Straits, the Dutch 
            could gain control of Straits trade. Raffles arrived in Singapore on board the Indiana on 28 January 1819. 
            Accompanied by William Farquhar and a sepoy, he met Temenggong Abdul Rahman to negotiate for a British 
            trading post to be established on the island. On 6 February 1819, Raffles signed an official treaty with 
            Sultan Hussein and the Temenggong and on this day, the Union Jack was officially hoisted in Singapore.
